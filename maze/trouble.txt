Parts of this project that gave me the most trouble

1. re-allocating memory for an int *
   a. What I wanted to do
      I wanted an int * to store the values read from stdin,
      but because I don't know the size of the stdin, I used
      dynamic arrays to malloc and realloc when needed.
   b. What I got
      I got my heap currupted because of the way I was reallocating
      the memory for my int * reading from stdin
      errmsg: "invalid next size"
   c. What the problem was
      The problem was because I was allocating for ints in a char
      way. So instead of allocating only sizes that are multiple of 4
      I allocating 2 and next I want to realloc by saying maxSize +=2.
      so that make maxSize 4 bytes which is not > the sizeof(int) I malloc'd
      first.
   d. How I solved it
      I solved it by first defining maxSize to be a multiple of four
      maxSize = 2 * (sizeof(int))
      then realloc with numbers greater than two multiplied by sizeof(int)
      tmp2 = realloc(tmp1, maxSize += 3 * sizeof(int)
      instead of 3 I can use any number greater than the initial size 2

2. My findPath function wasn't running the recursive calls
   -- because I was comparing maze values to 1 instead of '1'
   -- because I use getchar to read into maze or for some other reason
   -- that was a problem

3. maze2 would not work:
   -- I did maze[i] = malloc(N) where N is number of rows
   -- I should have done maze[i] = malloc(sizeof(int) * N)
   -- that solved the problem

4. Double free problem when I run maze5.in
   -- The last line I realloc'd I set tmp1 = tmp2
   -- meaning the point to the same thing but the end of main I free both
   -- which cause I error
